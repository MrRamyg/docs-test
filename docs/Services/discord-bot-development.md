- **Bot Features**: Additional features such as advanced moderation, multi-server support, or custom integrations can influence the price.
- **Licensing**: Some bots may require specific licenses or API usage, which could impact the final pricing.
- **Maintenance & Hosting**: Ongoing support, hosting, and maintenance are offered as optional services and may incur additional costs.
