## Roblox Development Pricing

At **NexAris Digital Systems**, we understand that **every project is unique**, and the cost of your Roblox game will depend on multiple factors. Our aim is to provide **fair, transparent, and competitive custom pricing** that aligns with the specific needs of your project. Whether you need a simple game or a highly complex, immersive experience, we’ll work closely with you to ensure your vision is brought to life without compromise.

### **Custom Pricing for Roblox Game Development**
Unlike standardized pricing models, **we offer custom pricing for each project**, based on the specific requirements, complexity, and features you need. Here's a breakdown of what we take into account when determining the cost:

#### 1. **Game Complexity**
- **Simple Games:** These include basic platformers, obstacle courses, and simple simulations. Generally, these are quicker to develop, requiring minimal scripts, and will fall under a more affordable pricing bracket.
- **Mid-Level Games:** These games often require **advanced mechanics**, custom scripting, AI, or multiplayer modes. Expect a higher price range based on the complexity and amount of work involved.
- **Large-Scale Projects:** Games that require **highly detailed scripting, complex worlds, multiplayer experiences**, or unique game engines will require more time, resources, and expertise. Pricing is dependent on the complexity and time commitment involved.

#### 2. **Game Features**
- **Basic Features:** This includes things like basic game mechanics, simple UI elements, and moderate scripting. These features are usually quicker to implement and fall on the lower end of the pricing spectrum.
- **Advanced Features:** If you require features such as **custom animations, virtual economies, multiplayer functionality, custom assets**, or **AI integration**, this will add to the overall cost. The more custom features, the higher the price.
- **In-Game Purchases / Monetization:** If you plan to have **in-game purchases**, microtransactions, or premium currency, this requires special development attention and integration with Roblox’s economy system, which can affect pricing.

#### 3. **Assets and Custom Models**
- **Custom 3D Models:** If you need **custom models, textures**, or assets created specifically for your game, the cost will vary based on the complexity of the models and the number required.
- **Animations & Effects:** Custom **animations** (character movements, combat animations, etc.) and visual effects (particle systems, dynamic lighting) will increase the overall cost.
- **Sound & Music:** For games requiring **unique soundtracks** or sound effects, additional costs will be included to source or create these assets.

#### 4. **Licensing and Roblox Platform Fees**
- **Roblox Platform Fee (30%):** Please be aware that Roblox takes a **30% transaction fee** from any revenue made via in-game purchases or premium currency. We factor this into the pricing to ensure there are no surprises when you go live with your game. 
- **Upfront Payment:** In some cases, an **upfront deposit or payment** may be required, particularly for larger, more complex projects. This ensures that we have the necessary resources and time allocated to bring your game to life.

#### 5. **Maintenance & Updates**
- **Ongoing Support:** Once your game is live, we offer **ongoing maintenance**, **bug fixes**, and **content updates**. This is priced separately and can be structured on a **monthly or hourly basis** depending on your requirements.
- **Custom Features & Future Updates:** As Roblox games often require updates or new features after launch, we can also provide ongoing development and new features post-launch. This allows your game to stay fresh and continue to engage users over time.

### **Pricing Transparency**
We believe in **full transparency** when it comes to pricing. We’ll provide you with an **estimated quote** based on your project’s needs, and we’re always open to adjusting our approach based on your budget. Our pricing model is flexible, and we’ll ensure that the price reflects the value and quality we’re bringing to your project.

### **Important Notice:**
Due to the **Roblox 30% platform fee**, it’s important to note that your final price may be adjusted to account for this. **Upfront payments** may be required for larger projects, but we’re always happy to discuss the terms and find a solution that works for you.

We understand that every budget is different, and we are always open to working with you to ensure the pricing fits your project needs.
