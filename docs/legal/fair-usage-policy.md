<summary><strong>3. Usage Limitations</strong></summary>

While we offer flexible and scalable hosting solutions, your plan may come with certain limitations based on the resources allocated to it.

### **Plan-Specific Restrictions:**
- **CPU and Memory Usage:** Each hosting plan has an allocated limit for CPU and memory usage. Going beyond these limits consistently may result in throttling, suspension, or termination of services.
- **Bandwidth:** Hosting plans include a set amount of monthly bandwidth. Exceeding your plan’s bandwidth limit may result in additional charges, throttling, or suspension of services.
- **Storage:** Hosting plans are provided with a predefined amount of storage. Excessive storage consumption beyond this limit without prior approval may result in service suspension or termination.

### **Fair Usage of Resources:**
Our infrastructure is designed to be used efficiently. If a user consistently exceeds normal resource usage, we reserve the right to take corrective action to ensure the integrity of the hosting environment, including limiting services or requesting the user upgrade their plan.

<summary><strong>4. System Maintenance and Security Measures</strong></summary>

### **Scheduled Maintenance:**
We may need to perform scheduled maintenance from time to time. In such cases, we will notify you in advance whenever possible. Please note that maintenance times are generally outside of normal business hours.

### **Security Measures:**
To maintain a secure hosting environment, we may implement automated security scripts and monitoring tools. These tools may include:
- **Abuse detection systems** that may temporarily limit or suspend accounts suspected of violating this policy.
- **Security patches and updates** to ensure system integrity and prevent security breaches.
- **DDoS protection** and other mitigation measures to protect the network from malicious attacks.

While these measures help protect the platform and its users, we will not be liable for service interruptions caused by security or maintenance activities.

<summary><strong>5. User Accountability and Account Security</strong></summary>

### **Account Security:**
You are solely responsible for keeping your account secure. This includes keeping your login credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data safe. If you suspect any unauthorized access to your account, you must notify us immediately.

### **Account Termination Protocol:**
If your account is found to be in violation of our Fair Usage Policy, we may suspend or terminate your account at our discretion. In most cases, we will provide a warning and a chance to rectify the issue. However, in severe cases of abuse, immediate termination of the account may occur.

### **Re-Creation of Account (Where Applicable):**
In some situations, if an account is terminated, we may follow our protocol to either temporarily suspend or re-create the account, depending on the severity of the violation.
